# DNS Root Server System Monitoring

This repository contains ICANN-sponsored RSS monitoring code and related
documentation.  The primary objective is to use the [RIPE
Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net/) system as a source of measurement data
from which to periodically poll as a data source for graphs and reports.
The RSSAC Metrics Work Party (in progress) is developing the measurement
and monitoring requirements from which this work will be based.
